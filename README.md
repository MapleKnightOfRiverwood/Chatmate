# Chatmate
Chatmate is a chat-based personal assistant that can help user with all kinds of tasks. It is developed based on on OpenAI's GPT natural language model.

Main differences from ChatGPT:
1. Chatmate is built around the idea of being more human-like with simulated personality and self-awareness
2. Chatmate has long term memory, which allows it to remember all your previous conversations, including the tasks you were working on, your personal preferences, etc. These features allow it to learn and grow as you interact with it, and it will become more efficient to work with as time goes by.
3. You can choose to reset its memory by saying 'obliviate'. However, once reset, it will forget everything, including who you are. Removed memories are not recoverable.
4. You can try to build a long lasing relationship with it
5. Will still work when ChatGPT server is down or at full capacity

Chatmate is purely console based at this stage (Beta). GUI will be updated in later versions.
More language support will be added in later versions.
